hey! thanks for checking this out. Sorry that it is still wip, I am trying to
learn how to build Domain Driven Design style backend. I figured the best way to
do that is to build it!

I chose go for this project becuase ive been wanting to learn it for a while
now, and it just seems like a good fit.
